// Golden response harness (#755, Phase 1).
//
// This is a before-and-after photo of the API. It drives every route the router registers
// against a freshly seeded database, records the status and body of each response, and
// compares them to committed fixtures. Its whole purpose is to make the typed-response
// migration safe: 2278 of 2321 response sites currently build anonymous gin.H maps, and
// converting them to Go structs must not change what any client receives.
//
// Two properties matter more than convenience here:
//
//   - **Nothing is silently skipped.** Every registered route is either covered by a fixture
//     or named in goldenExclusions with a reason, and TestGoldenCoverage fails when a route
//     is neither. A route quietly missing from the fixtures would refactor with no safety
//     net while the suite still reported green, which is the exact failure this exists to
//     prevent.
//   - **Comparison is on parsed values, not bytes.** encoding/json sorts map keys but
//     marshals struct fields in declaration order, so replacing a map with a struct
//     necessarily reorders keys. Byte equality is therefore unachievable by construction;
//     deep equality after normalisation pins every key, value, type and null while letting
//     order move. See the spec for why that is safe (no test or client string-matches a
//     response body).
//
// The database is a throwaway, created and dropped by this test, never $TEST_DATABASE_URL
// itself - that URL points at a development database with no backup.

// timeSensitiveRoutes aggregate over calendar windows or live status, so their numbers move with
// the wall clock. Their shape is pinned; their numbers are not.
//
// This was found the hard way. The fixtures were first recorded and re-verified within a few
// hours, which hid it entirely; a day later ten endpoints reported spurious diffs
// (completed_terraform_runs_this_month 5 -> 3, errored_workspaces 2 -> 0) with no code change
// behind them - the flaky-test failure mode the harness exists to avoid.
//
// Pinning the SEED clock was the obvious fix and it is done (goldenSeedInstant), which removed
// the daily component: the dataset is now byte-reproducible for a given --seed and --now. It is
// NOT sufficient, and that was measured rather than assumed. Moving the anchor from September to
// June changed completed_terraform_runs_this_month from 1 to 0, because these handlers evaluate
// "this month" against the SERVER's clock, not against the data. The harness drives the router
// in-process over HTTP and has no way to pin that.
//
// So the numbers are normalised away for these routes while every key, nesting level, type and
// null is still pinned - which is the property a representational refactor can actually break.
// Removing this list entirely would need the handlers to take an injectable clock, which is a
// change to production code for a test's benefit and is not obviously worth it.
//
// Blanking numbers alone turned out to be incomplete for the same reason, one layer down. The
// analytics daily series labels each bucket with a calendar date ("2026-09-06"), which is a
// string, so blankNumbers left it pinned and the fixture failed on the next calendar day with
// the whole window shifted by one entry - exactly the spurious diff this list exists to
// prevent. Whole-string dates are therefore blanked too, and only whole-string ones: a date
// embedded in a seeded name ("baseline-compliance - 2026-08-23 11:01") comes from the pinned
// seed clock, is stable, and stays pinned.

// Replaying real mutations against the seeded data would make each fixture depend on the order
// the previous ones ran in, and would destroy the resources the GET fixtures describe. So every
// path parameter is deliberately set to a non-existent identifier and the body is empty: the
// handler rejects the request before touching anything, and what gets recorded is the envelope
// - status, `errors` array, object shape.
//
// That envelope is not a consolation prize. AC2 replaces 632 hand-built error payloads with one
// shared type, and this fixture set is what proves that substitution changed nothing. It runs
// against its own freshly seeded database so a mutation that slips through cannot contaminate
// the response fixtures.
